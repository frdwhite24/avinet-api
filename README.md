  <h1 align="center">AviNet API üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏èüõ©Ô∏èüöÅ</h1>
</p>

This project is the back-end of a social network and online log record for
pilots. See it as a Strava for people that love flying! AviNet is short for
Aviation Network.

The back-end is a GraphQL API built in Typescript using Apollo Server.

> This project is still in development and should not be relied upon. For
> project backlog, see the Projects tab of the repository.

## Planned AviNet features

_(Prioritise the below list)_

- A user can make a profile page which holds key information about them, they
  can choose what is public and what is private about their account
  (authentication & privacy settings required).
- A user can log a flight. When they are doing this, they can choose which
  aircraft they flew, which airport they flew to and from, and other key
  metrics typically recorded in the flight log book such as flying hours,
  landings & take-offs, whether they were a pilot under instruction, commanding
  pilot, co-pilot, date and time. Based on the date and time, the weather is
  automatically populated. The flight will have a title, a description of how
  it went, maybe some photos to go with it. Embedded with the flight post is a
  map showing their route from each airfield, or a halo around one airfield if
  they did airfield work or flew from and to the same airfield.
- Users can see their own personal log book on their profiles.
- A user can follow other users and see more detailed information about the
  people that accept their requests (authorisation required).
- A user can see all of the people they follow and their recent flights in a
  main feed.
- A user can comment on and like the flights of other people (maybe limit this
  to only people who have accepted their follow requests?).
- A user can see in an 'Explore' tab, who else has been flying into and out of
  any airfield they've been to, assuming the post is publically visible and not
  private.
- Users get rewards/ rankings based on a metric such as hours flown or number
  of airfields flow into etc. Rank/level/rewards are shown on profile. Maybe
  challenges similar to Duolingo.
- ?? A user can send messages to other users if they follow each other ??
- ?? A user can plan their upcoming flights, be given links to key resources
  such as NOTAMs, official weather sources, aviation maps ??
- ?? A user can record their flights using GPS on their phone or by uploading
  the correct file and then can see the route on an embedded map for each
  flight ??
